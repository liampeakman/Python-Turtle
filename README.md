# Python-Turtle
Assignment using Python's Turtle graphics module.

This assignment tests your skills at defining functions, processing data stored in lists and efficiently repeating multiple actions in order to display a complex visual image. The incomplete Python script below is missing a crucial function, "build_city". You are required to complete this function so that when the program is run it draws a city whose plan is determined by randomly-generated data stored in a list which specifies what style of building to erect on particular sites. See the instruction sheet accompanying this file for full details.

Note that this assignment is in two parts, the second of which will be released only just before the final deadline. This template file will be used for both parts and you will submit your final solution as a single Python 3 file, whether or not you complete both parts of the assignment.
